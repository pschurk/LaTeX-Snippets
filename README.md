# LaTeX-Snippets
A collection of various snippets to write LaTeX more efficiently with (n)vim and UltiSnips.

UltiSnips works with both vim and neovim.

To use these snippets, just copy them into the `UltiSnips` folder under `.vim/` or `.config/nvim/`. The file `snippets.snippets` is a snippet file that allows to write snippets fast by just typing `snip` and pressing the trigger key.
